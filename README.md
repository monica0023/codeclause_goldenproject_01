# Building a resume parser using NLP (Natural Language Processing) with spaCy and machine learning refers to creating a software application that can automatically extract relevant information from resumes. Resumes often contain structured and unstructured information about an individual's educational background, work experience, skills, and contact details. The goal of a resume parser is to process these resumes and extract specific pieces of information in a structured format.

# Here's a breakdown of the key components and steps mentioned:

# NLP (Natural Language Processing): 

NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text. In this context, NLP is used to analyze and extract meaningful information from resumes written in natural language.

# spaCy: 

spaCy is a popular open-source library for advanced natural language processing in Python. It provides pre-trained models and tools for tasks like named entity recognition (NER), which is crucial for identifying entities such as names, job titles, and skills in resumes.

# Machine Learning: 

Machine learning is employed to train models, specifically a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model in this case. The NER model is trained to recognize and categorize entities (e.g., names, job titles, years of experience) in the text.
