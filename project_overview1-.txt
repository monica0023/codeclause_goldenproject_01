Step 1: Define Data Schema
Decide on the data structure you want to extract from resumes. Common fields include Name, Email, Phone, Education, Work Experience, Skills, etc.

Step 2: Preprocess Data
Preprocess your resume data by converting it into a format that can be easily fed into the machine learning model. Clean and normalize the text, remove irrelevant information.

Step 3: Train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model
Use spaCy to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify entities like names, emails, phone numbers, etc. Create training data with annotated entities and train the model.
Step 4: Extract Information
Use the trained NER model to extract information from resumes. Parse the resume text and extract entities.

python
Copy code
text = "John Doe is a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience."
doc = nlp(text)

for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"Entity: {ent.text}, Label: {ent.label_}")
Step 5: Build a Classifier (Optional)
If you want to categorize resumes into different classes (e.g., software engineer, data scientist), you can build a classification model using machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, etc.

Step 6: Create a User Interface (Optional)
Build a user interface to upload resumes and display parsed information. Flask is a popular choice for building web applications in Python.

Step 7: Test and Iterate
Test your resume parser with a variety of resume formats. Iterate and improve the model based on feedback and performance.
