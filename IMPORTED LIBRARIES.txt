from nltk import pos_tag: This imports the POS tagging function from NLTK. It will be used to tag parts of speech in a sentence.

from nltk.corpus import stopwords: This imports the NLTK stopwords corpus, which contains common words (e.g., "the," "and," "is") that are often removed in text processing tasks because they carry little meaning.

nltk.download('stopwords'), nltk.download('wordnet'), nltk.download('omw-1.4'): These lines download additional resources from NLTK, including the stopwords list, WordNet (a lexical database of English), and Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) version 1.4.

import string: This imports the string module, which provides common string operations and constants like punctuation characters.
